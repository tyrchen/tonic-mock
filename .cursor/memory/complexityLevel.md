# Complexity Level Assessment

## Overall Complexity: Level 3

The planned enhancements for the tonic-mock library represent a Level 3 complexity task, characterized by:

1. Multiple interrelated components requiring coordination
2. Significant expansion of existing API surface
3. Complex implementation details for new functionality
4. Comprehensive testing requirements
5. Advanced documentation needs

## Component Complexity Breakdown

### Core Testing Infrastructure (Level 2)
- Setting up test directory structure (Low complexity)
- Creating unit tests for existing functionality (Moderate complexity)
- Setting up CI/CD pipeline (Moderate complexity)

### API Extensions (Level 3)
- Error injection implementation (High complexity)
  - Requires implementing custom stream handling
  - Needs thread-safe error pattern mechanisms
  - Must properly integrate with tonic streaming

- Timeout configuration (Moderate complexity)
  - Requires timing mechanism integration
  - Must handle timeout events appropriately

- Interceptor support (Moderate complexity)
  - Needs to properly integrate with tonic's interceptor pattern
  - Must handle both success and error cases

- Bidirectional streaming (High complexity)
  - Requires implementing request-response mapping
  - Needs thread-safe handler mechanisms
  - Must properly manage async stream lifetimes

- Builder pattern implementation (Moderate complexity)
  - Requires designing a flexible and usable API
  - Must integrate all features coherently

### Documentation Enhancements (Level 2)
- README improvements (Low complexity)
- API documentation enhancement (Moderate complexity)
- Examples creation (Moderate complexity)
- Documentation website (Moderate complexity)

## Implementation Challenges

1. **Stream Manipulation**: Working with `Pin<Box<dyn Stream>>` and other complex async types
2. **Error Handling**: Properly propagating and handling errors in different scenarios
3. **Thread Safety**: Ensuring thread-safe access to shared state
4. **API Design**: Creating a cohesive and intuitive API for complex functionality
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of asynchronous streaming behavior
6. **Documentation**: Clearly explaining complex concepts and patterns

## Required Knowledge Areas

1. Rust async/await patterns
2. tonic internals and streaming model
3. Protocol Buffers with prost
4. HTTP/2 and gRPC concepts
5. Rust trait system and generic programming
6. Thread-safe programming patterns
7. Builder pattern and other API design patterns

## Implementation Approach

The complexity level requires a phased implementation approach:

1. Begin with establishing the testing infrastructure
2. Implement core API extensions one at a time, starting with simpler features
3. Use the builder pattern to provide a cohesive interface
4. Enhance documentation as features are completed
5. Complete the implementation with performance benchmarks

This measured approach allows for testing and validation at each step, reducing the risk of integration issues or design flaws.
