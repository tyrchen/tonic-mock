- [ ] Add compatibility tests for different tonic versions

## Implementation Priorities
1. ~~Comprehensive test suite (highest priority)~~ âœ…
2. Core API extensions (in progress)
3. Documentation improvements
4. Infrastructure enhancements

## Backlog
- [ ] Review test coverage and identify gaps
- [ ] Check compatibility with latest tonic and prost versions
- [ ] Identify potential areas for optimization
- [ ] Consider adding more comprehensive example code
- [ ] Evaluate error handling robustness

## Ideas for Enhancement
