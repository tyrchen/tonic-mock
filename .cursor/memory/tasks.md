## Completed Tasks
- [x] Initialize memory bank with project context
- [x] Analyze codebase structure and dependencies
- [x] Document core API functionality
- [x] Document system patterns and technical context

## Enhancement Plan
### Core API Extensions
- [ ] Add configurable timeout for streaming operations
- [ ] Implement error injection capabilities for testing error handling
- [ ] Support for interceptors in mock requests
- [ ] Add utility for testing bidirectional streaming

### Testing Improvements

- [ ] Add integration tests with sample gRPC service
- [ ] Implement property-based testing for robustness
- [ ] Add benchmarks for performance validation

### Documentation Enhancements
- [ ] Expand README with more detailed examples
- [ ] Add tutorial for common testing scenarios
- [ ] Create example project demonstrating best practices
- [ ] Improve inline documentation with more context

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement automated release process
- [ ] Add compatibility tests for different tonic versions

## Implementation Priorities
1. Comprehensive test suite (highest priority)
2. Documentation improvements
3. Core API extensions
4. Infrastructure enhancements

## Backlog
- [ ] Review test coverage and identify gaps
- [ ] Check compatibility with latest tonic and prost versions
- [ ] Identify potential areas for optimization
- [ ] Consider adding more comprehensive example code
- [ ] Evaluate error handling robustness

## Ideas for Enhancement
