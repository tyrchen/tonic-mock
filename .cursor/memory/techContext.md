# Technical Context

## Development Environment
- Rust 2018 edition
- Build system: Cargo
- Platform: Cross-platform

## Dependencies
- `bytes` (1.x): Utilities for working with bytes
- `futures` (0.3.x): Asynchronous programming constructs
- `http-body` (1.x): Types for HTTP message bodies
- `http` (1.x): HTTP types and utilities
- `prost` (0.13.x): Protocol Buffers implementation for Rust
- `tonic` (0.13.x): gRPC implementation for Rust

## Dev Dependencies
- `async-stream` (0.3.x): Macros for writing asynchronous streams
- `tokio` (1.x): Asynchronous runtime with multi-threading support

## Key Types
- `StreamResponseInner<T>`: `Pin<Box<dyn Stream<Item = Result<T, Status>> + Send + Sync>>`
- `StreamResponse<T>`: `Response<StreamResponseInner<T>>`
- `MockBody`: Custom implementation of HTTP body for mocking
- `ProstDecoder<U>`: Decoder for Protocol Buffer messages

## Core Functions
1. `streaming_request<T>`: Creates a mock request stream from a vector of messages
2. `process_streaming_response<T, F>`: Processes a streaming response with a closure
3. `stream_to_vec<T>`: Converts a streaming response to a vector

## Testing Approach
The library supports unit testing of gRPC services by:
1. Mocking the request stream with predefined messages
2. Capturing and validating the streaming response
3. Converting complex streaming responses to vectors for easier assertions

## Known Limitations
- Designed for testing purposes only, not for production use
- Focused on streaming interfaces specifically
