# Product Context

## Purpose
`tonic-mock` addresses the challenge of testing gRPC services with streaming interfaces. It provides utilities that simplify the creation of test scenarios for tonic-based services, focusing specifically on the streaming aspects which are typically difficult to test.

## Target Users
- Rust developers building gRPC services with tonic
- QA engineers and testers working with Rust gRPC applications
- Developers seeking to implement thorough test coverage for streaming APIs

## Use Cases
1. **Mock Streaming Requests**: Create test streams of request messages
2. **Test Request Processing**: Verify server correctly processes streaming requests
3. **Validate Streaming Responses**: Process and validate streaming responses
4. **Convert Streams to Collections**: Transform streaming responses into vectors for simplified assertion

## Benefits
- Reduces test code complexity
- Decreases boilerplate in test files
- Makes streaming interface tests more reliable
- Simplifies assertion logic for streaming responses

## Design Goals
- Keep the API simple and intuitive
- Maintain compatibility with tonic's design patterns
- Focus exclusively on testing needs
- Provide meaningful examples in documentation

## Positioning
- Testing utility, not for production use
- Complements tonic's core functionality
- Focused on a specific pain point (streaming interface testing)
- Lightweight dependency with minimal footprint
